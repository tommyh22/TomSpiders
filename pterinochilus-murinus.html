  <h1>Pterinochilus murinus</h1>
  <h3>The Orange Baboon Tarantula (OBT)</h3>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Pterinochilus murinus</em>, commonly referred to as the OBT (Orange Baboon Tarantula) 
      or jokingly as the “Orange Bitey Thing,” is a beautiful and often misunderstood Old World 
      species found across several Central African countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      This species occurs in multiple colour forms, but the most commonly encountered in the hobby 
      is the iconic bright orange morph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite its reputation for being highly aggressive, this behaviour is often exaggerated and 
      usually linked to incorrect husbandry rather than true temperament. Although very fast, the OBT 
      is actually a shy and aloof species that prefers to hide away and avoid unnecessary interaction. 
      In most situations, it will retreat rather than seek confrontation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interestingly, OBTs are known to display “semi-arboreal” tendencies, creating dense webbing 
      higher up in the enclosure than typical terrestrial species. At the same time, they may also 
      show fossorial (burrowing) behaviour — a fascinating combination seldom seen together.
    </p>

    <p>
      This species thrives in arid to semi-arid conditions, similar to the dry habitats of its 
      native regions.

    <p><strong>Humidity:</strong> 50–70% (good ventilation, avoid overly moist substrate)</p>
    <p><strong>Enclosure:</strong> Dry substrate, sturdy anchor points for webbing, cork bark hides</p>
    <p><strong>Feeding:</strong> Fast eater; offer appropriate-sized crickets/roaches regularly</p>
  </div>

  <!-- TEMPERAMENT -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Temperament</h2>
    <p>
      The OBT is often portrayed as aggressively defensive, but this is largely due to poor husbandry. 
      In reality, it is a shy, secretive species that prefers to retreat rather than fight. However, 
      it <em>will</em> defend itself if provoked, and keepers should always use caution.
    </p>
    <p><strong>No handling recommended.</strong></p>
